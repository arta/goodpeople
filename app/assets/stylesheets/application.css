/*
 * This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css, which will include all the files
 * listed below.
 *
 * Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, vendor/assets/stylesheets,
 * or any plugin's vendor/assets/stylesheets directory can be referenced here using a relative path.
 *
 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the bottom of the
 * compiled file so the styles you add here take precedence over styles defined in any styles
 * defined in the other CSS/SCSS files in this directory. It is generally better to create a new
 * file per style scope.
 *
 * 5-4-15: !!!!!!!!!!!! IMPORTANT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:
 * I put `require foundation_and_overrides` above rqr tree . & self,
 * to fix (?) order of css styles loading (specificity was out of order)
 * originally, it was put by Foundation below rqr tree . & self
 *
 *= require foundation_and_overrides
 *= require_tree .
 *= require_self
